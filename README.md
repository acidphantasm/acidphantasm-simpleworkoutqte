# Welcome to the SimpleHideoutQTE

### All this does is make the QTE for working out in the hideout easier.

##
Set "easyMode" to true to make the QTE much slower, much larger, and static (it doesn't shrink) 
##
"qteSpeed" is the modifier for how quickly the indicator moves. (0.5 = half speed) 
##
"qteSize" is the modifier for how large the success window is. (2 = double size success window) 
##
"preventVeryDifficultQTE" doesn't allow windows smaller than 0.07 (when it's a tiny sliver)
